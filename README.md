<p style="text-align:center">Instant text highlighting. Simple, lightweight, and dependency-free!</p>


## Objective:

Have you ever needed to highlight text while reviewing or editing a document, like in a PDF editor, but found libraries full of dependencies, complex setups, and limited customization?

With Text-Highlighter, you can apply highlights or underlines to selected text in real time using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external dependencies. Just lightweight, functional, and easy to use.

This implementation also supports undo and redo, allowing users to revert or reapply their highlights effortlessly.

## How to use:

- Go to original code stored in [index.html](./index.html) and [editor.js](./editor.js).
- Copy css code.
- Copy html code.
- Copy javascript code.

You can separate and organize the files however you want, as long as the css and javascript are properly linked to the html.

- Add the desired content inside the div#text.
